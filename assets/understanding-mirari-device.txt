**Mechanisms of Action**
CAP's actions are largely dominated by its ability to generate a variety of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). These RONS have the ability to interact with various biological molecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to various biological effects. For instance, in cancer cells, these interactions can lead to cell death, either through apoptosis (programmed cell death) or necrosis (cell death due to injury). In wound healing, these interactions can promote the proliferation of skin cells and enhance the body's immune response, leading to faster wound closure. In addition, the generation of RONS can also lead to the inactivation of various pathogens, making CAP an effective antimicrobial agent.

**Research Support**
Research on CAP is extensive and has branched into fields like human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and food safety. In cancer therapy, CAP has shown potential in inhibiting tumor growth and enhancing chemotherapy efficacy. For instance, one study revealed that CAP treatment could suppress the proliferation of breast cancer cells and improve chemotherapy outcomes. Another study demonstrated CAP's effectiveness in promoting wound healing and reducing bacterial infections in chronic wounds.

Research into CAP has been extensive and has recently expanded into areas such as animal and human medicine, as well as the agriculture and food industry. The application of CAP in cancer therapy has shown promising results, making it a potential guide for future clinical studies. For instance, a study found that CAP treatment could inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells and enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy.

In another study, CAP was found to be effective in promoting wound healing and reducing bacterial infection in chronic wounds [Explore CAP's role in wound healing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3890976/).
**Conditions Treated**

CAP has proven to be effective in treating a variety of conditions. This includes cancer, wounds, burns, diabetic ulcers, and chronic pain. In cancer treatment, CAP has been found to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapy. In wound healing, CAP treatment can promote the proliferation of skin cells and enhance the body's immune response, leading to faster wound closure.
In the treatment of burns, Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) has shown promising results. A study conducted by Betancourt-Ángeles et al. demonstrated the application of CAP on two second-degree burns caused by boiling oil. The patient reported no itching or pain after the first treatment, and new tissue was observed after the second treatment. This opens up the possibility of using CAP as a treatment for burns.

Another study by Abbasi et al. evaluated the effect of CAP on Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, which are often found in burn wound infections. The study found that non-thermal atmospheric plasma inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The non-thermal helium plasma accelerated wound healing over a period of 6 days. The study concluded that CAP could be suggested as a complementary therapeutic protocol to reduce bacterial infection and accelerate wound healing.

In the treatment of diabetic ulcers, Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) has shown significant potential. A randomized clinical trial conducted by Stratmann et al. found that the application of CAP significantly improved the healing process in patients with diabetic foot ulcers. The healing rate was more pronounced in the plasma group than in the placebo group. [Learn about CAP in diabetic ulcer treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7366186/).
Another study by Mirpour et al. found that CAP treatment effectively reduced the fraction of wound size. After three weeks, the wounds to reach a fraction wound size of ≤0.5 was significantly greater in the group treated with CAP. The study concluded that CAP can be an efficient method to accelerate wound healing in diabetic foot ulcers, with immediate antiseptic effects.

In the treatment of chronic pain, Cold Atmospheric Plasma (CAP) has shown promising results. A study conducted by Isbary et al. demonstrated the application of CAP on chronic wounds. The study found that a 2-minute treatment with cold atmospheric argon plasma significantly reduced the bacterial load in chronic wounds. No side-effects occurred, and the treatment was well tolerated. [Successful and safe use of 2 min cold atmospheric argon plasma in chronic wounds: results of a randomized controlled trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22385038/). This suggests that CAP could potentially be used to manage chronic pain associated with such wounds.
Another review by Bernhardt et al. highlighted the applications of CAP in dermatology. The review noted that CAP has anti-itch, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, tissue-stimulating, blood flow-enhancing, and proapoptotic effects. These effects were demonstrated in vivo and in vitro experiments, and no resistance of pathogens against plasma treatment was observed. The review concluded that plasma medicine, especially in dermatology, holds great promise.
